## 2026-09-02 — Local Luminos simulation boundary

Adaptive Optopatch now supports local runner development through a deliberately
small, duck-typed Luminos test backend. The simulator implements only the API
surface used by the 1P/2P resolvers and manifest runners. Numerical planning,
validation, target preparation, waveform construction, checkpointing, and GUI
code remain shared with real operation.

The global `Waveform_Camera_Sync_Acquisition` call was placed behind
`adaptive_optopatch.execute_waveform_camera_sync`. Dispatch to synthetic
completion requires the explicit class identity
`adaptive_optopatch.testing.SimulatedLuminosApp`; a similarly named property on
an arbitrary object is insufficient. This is the safety boundary that prevents
simulation from reaching hardware acquisition code while preserving the
unchanged real-Luminos default.

The simulated app owns an in-memory synthetic Camera 1/galvo calibration. The
2P resolver and settings snapshot use that artifact only for the explicit
simulator class, avoiding reads or writes to the persistent active-calibration
store. Simulated 2P feedback copies commanded X/Y samples so integration and
metadata paths can be tested without claiming to model galvo dynamics.

For parity with the normal operator workflow, `simulatedLuminosApp()` is a
top-level constructor-style facade over the package factory. It still returns
the explicitly recognized `adaptive_optopatch.testing.SimulatedLuminosApp`
class, preserving the acquisition safety boundary.

## 2026-09-02 — Unified editable-plan and frozen-run workflow

`AdaptiveOptopatchApp` now extends the established reference/ROI planner and is
the primary operator interface. The base planner exposes its implementation to
subclasses and calls a small `planChanged` hook; the ROI drawing, renumbering,
QC, restoration, contrast, target generation, and artifact schemas therefore
remain single implementations rather than being copied into another GUI.

The unified app maintains three explicit states: `DIRTY`, `VALIDATED`, and
`RUNNING`. Validation stores a value snapshot containing reference, targets,
manifest, and planning session. A run first writes that snapshot through the
existing bundle serializer with an `adaptive_optopatch_run` prefix, then passes
the frozen manifest and targets to the existing modality-specific runner.
Planning controls and ROI interaction are locked during execution. Safety
confirmations remain current operator actions, while waveform, power, release,
and motion parameters come from the frozen planning session during execution
and resume.

Resume loads the frozen provenance artifacts directly. It does not rebuild
the manifest from the editable GUI. The 2P manifest runner was updated to reload
its existing checkpoint, matching the already-resumable 1P behavior.

## 2026-09-02 — Pulse protocols become independent design artifacts

Pulse timing was removed from the unified acquisition GUI and made a canonical,
versioned input artifact. The common event schema is `event_id`, `condition_id`,
`onset_s`, `duration_s`, and `amplitude_fraction`. STF train rows may additionally
carry their pulse times and train metadata. Absolute mod488 and Pockels voltages
remain hardware settings; final waveform realization multiplies the canonical
relative amplitude by the frozen GUI voltage.

`normalize_protocol` preserves supported legacy timing aliases and converts
legacy voltage patterns to fractions relative to their largest positive
voltage. The old voltage is retained only as a backward-compatible realization
fallback. New GUI plans use `build_manifest`, which accepts an already validated
protocol and never regenerates timing from controls.

Every frozen run now includes `pulse_protocol.mat` alongside the spatial target,
manifest, session, and checkpoint artifacts. Resume requires this archived copy,
so an unavailable original design-script output cannot silently change what is
run. The GUI stores the source path for editable-session restoration but reports
a missing path and requires an explicit replacement selection.

## 2026-09-02 — Unified GUI height allocation

The unified app reserves fixed heights for the pulse-protocol controls and trial
table. Planning rows are compacted after obsolete pulse-design controls are
hidden, and surplus window height is assigned to the camera/planning region.
This keeps both operator control sets visible while allowing the camera image to
benefit from a larger window.

## 2026-09-03 — Legacy Luminos snapshot compatibility

Luminos snapshots written before `CL_RefImage` gained `bin` and `timestamp`
remain valid reference images. The reader infers missing binning from the saved
world limits and image dimensions, uses the MAT file modification time when the
capture time is absent, and accepts the earlier direct DMD-transform layout in
addition to the current named transform array. Camera identity checks remain in
place but are case-insensitive. Because MATLAB otherwise materializes a saved
`CL_RefImage` as an empty object when the class is unavailable, the reader adds
only Luminos's `src/utils/Data_Structures` directory from a sibling
`luminos-private` checkout when needed; it does not recursively add Luminos.

## 2026-09-03 — Pulse protocol script collection

Pulse-design scripts now live in the first-class `pulse-protocols` directory.
They cover randomized connectivity, fixed-rate pulses, mixed-frequency STF,
paired-pulse recovery, and explicit custom events while sharing the canonical
validation and serialization API. Generated MAT artifacts are written beneath
an ignored `generated` directory so source and experiment inputs remain
separate.
